This is a multi-package repo for some mapping and graph algorithm fun projects.

I recall, back in the day, MIT had the [6.170 course](https://web.archive.org/web/20080320044845/http://www.mit.edu/~6.170/).

And then the University of Washington borrowed the course and implemented it in [CSE 331](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/11wi/)

Finally, I saw a class on Coursera from UCSD [Advanced Data Structures in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures)

So, this is a repo for messing around with mapping and routing algs.
