# Two consecutive asterisks ("**") in patterns matched against
#   full pathname may have special meaning:
#
# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories.
# For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere,
# the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory
# "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
#
# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**"
# matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location
# of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
#
# A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or
# more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
#
# Other consecutive asterisks are considered regular asterisks and will
# match according to the previous rules.

# If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the
# following description, but it would only find a match with a directory.
# In other words, foo/ will match a directory foo and paths underneath it,
# but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo (this is consistent
# with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).
